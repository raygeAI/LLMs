# Getting started with HuggingFace optimization
In this section, we will learn about the 4 main steps needed to optimize your ðŸ¤— HuggingFace models:

1. [Input your model and data](#1-input-model-and-data)
2. [Run the optimization](#2-run-the-optimization)
3. [Save your optimized model](#3-save-your-optimized-model)
4. [Load and run your optimized model in production](#4-load-and-run-your-optimized-model-in-production)

## 1) Input model and data

!!! info
    In order to optimize a model with `Speedster`, first you should input the model you want to optimize and load some sample data that will be needed to test the optimization performances (latency, throughput, accuracy loss, etc). 

For HuggingFace models we support different types of input data depending on the architecture of your input model.

- [x]  For Decoder-only or Encoder-only architectures (Bert, GPT, etc), we support:

    - Dictionary
    - String

- [x]  For Encoder-Decoder architectures (T5 etc), we support: 
    - Dictionary


=== "Decoder-only or Encoder-only (Bert, GPT, etc)"
    **Input as Dictionary**

    ```python
    from transformers import AlbertModel, AlbertTokenizer

    # Load Albert as example
    model = AlbertModel.from_pretrained("albert-base-v1")
    tokenizer = AlbertTokenizer.from_pretrained("albert-base-v1")

    # Case 1: dictionary input format
    text = "This is an example text for the huggingface model."
    input_dict = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")
    input_data = [input_dict for _ in range(100)]
    ```
    Now your input model and data are ready, you can move on to [Run the optimization](#2-run-the-optimization) section ðŸš€.


    **Input as String**

    In the string case, the HuggingFace tokenizer must be given as input to the `optimize_model` in addition to the `input_data`, and the arguments for the tokenizer can be passed using the param `tokenizer_args`.

    ```python
    from transformers import AlbertModel, AlbertTokenizer

    # Load Albert as example
    model = AlbertModel.from_pretrained("albert-base-v1")
    tokenizer = AlbertTokenizer.from_pretrained("albert-base-v1")

    # Case 2: strings input format
    input_data = [
        "This is a test.",
        "Hi my name is John.",
        "The cat is on the table.",
    ]
    tokenizer_args = dict(
        return_tensors="pt",
        padding="longest",
        truncation=True,
    )
    ```
    Now your input model and data are ready, you can move on to [Run the optimization](#2-run-the-optimization) section ðŸš€.

=== "Encoder-Decoder architectures (T5 etc)"
    For encoder-decoder architectures we support only `input_data` as Dictionary:
    ```python
    from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration

    # Load T5 as example
    model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5-small")
    tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small") 

    # Case 1: dictionary input format
    question = "What's the meaning of life?"
    answer = "The answer is:"
    input_dict = tokenizer(question, return_tensors="pt")
    input_dict["decoder_input_ids"] = tokenizer(answer, return_tensors="pt").input_ids
    input_data = [input_dict for _ in range(100)]
    ```
    Now your input model and data are ready, you can move on to [Run the optimization](#2-run-the-optimization) section ðŸš€.


## 2) Run the optimization
Once the `model` and `input_data` have been defined, everything is ready to use Speedster's `optimize_model` function to optimize your model. 

The function takes the following arguments as inputs:

- `model`: model to be optimized in your preferred framework (HuggingFace in this case)
- `input_data`: sample data needed to test the optimization performances (latency, throughput, accuracy loss, etc)
- `optimization_time`: if "constrained" mode, `Speedster` takes advantage only of compilers and precision reduction techniques, such as quantization. "unconstrained" optimization_time allows it to exploit more time-consuming techniques, such as pruning and distillation 
- `metric_drop_ths`: maximum drop in your preferred accuracy metric that you are willing to trade to gain in acceleration

and returns the accelerated version of your model ðŸš€.

Depending on the format of your `input_data`, the `optimize_model` is as follows:

=== "Input as Dictionary"
    ```python
    from speedster import optimize_model

    # Run Speedster optimization
    optimized_model = optimize_model(
        model, 
        input_data=input_data, 
        optimization_time="constrained",
        metric_drop_ths=0.05
    )
    ```

=== "Input as String"
    ```python
    from speedster import optimize_model

    # Run Speedster optimization
    optimized_model = optimize_model(
        model, 
        input_data=input_data, 
        optimization_time="constrained", 
        metric_drop_ths=0.05,
        tokenizer=tokenizer,
        tokenizer_args={"return_tensors": "pt"}
    )
    ```

Internally, `Speedster` tries to use all the compilers and optimization techniques at its disposal along the software to hardware stack to optimize the model. From these, it will choose the ones with the lowest latency on the specific hardware.

At the end of the optimization, you are going to see the results in a summary table like the following:

![pt](../images/pt_table.png)

If the speedup you obtained is good enough for your application, you can move to the [Save your optimized model](#3-save-your-optimized-model) section to save your model and use it in production.

If you want to squeeze out even more acceleration out of the model, please see the [`optimize_model` API](../advanced_options.md#optimize_model-api) section. Consider if in your application you can trade off a little accuracy for much higher performance and use the `metric`, `metric_drop_ths` and `optimization_time` arguments accordingly.

## 3) Save your optimized model
After accelerating the model, it can be saved using the `save_model` function:

```python
from speedster import save_model

save_model(optimized_model, "model_save_path")
```

Now you are all set to use your optimized model in production. To explore how to do it, see the [Load and run your optimized model in production](#4-load-and-run-your-optimized-model-in-production) section.

## 4) Load and run your optimized model in production
Once the optimized model has been saved,  it can be loaded with the `load_model` function:
```python
from speedster import load_model

optimized_model = load_model("model_save_path")
```

The optimized model can be used for accelerated inference in the same way as the original model:

```python
# Use the accelerated version of your HuggingFace model in production
output = optimized_model(**input_sample)
```

!!! info
    The first 1-2 inferences could be a bit slower than expected because some compilers still perform some optimizations during the first iterations. After this warm-up time, the next ones will be faster than ever.
