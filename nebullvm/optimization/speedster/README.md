# 💥 Speedster

`Speedster` reduces inference costs by leveraging SOTA optimization techniques that best couple your AI models with the underlying hardware (GPUs and CPUs). The idea is to make AI inference way cheaper in just a few lines of code.

`Speedster` makes it easy to combine optimization techniques across the whole software-to-hardware stack, delivering best-in-class cost savings. If you like the idea, give us a star to support the project ⭐

The core `Speedster` workflow consists of 3 steps:

- [x]  **Select**: input your model in your preferred DL framework and express your preferences regarding:
    - Accuracy loss: do you want to trade off a little accuracy for significant cost savings?
    - Optimization time: achieving great savings can be time-consuming. Can you wait, or do you need an instant answer?
- [x]  **Search**: the library automatically tests every combination of optimization techniques across the software-to-hardware stack (sparsity, quantization, compilers, etc.) that is compatible with your needs and local hardware.
- [x]  **Serve**: finally, `Speedster` chooses the best configuration of optimization techniques and returns an accelerated version of your model in the DL framework of your choice (just cheaper 🚀).

# Quick start

Only one line of code - that’s what you need to accelerate your model! Find below your getting started guide for 5 different input model frameworks:

<details>
<summary>🔥 PyTorch </summary>
    
In this section, we will learn about the 4 main steps needed to optimize PyTorch models:

1) Input your model and data
2) Run the optimization
3) Save your optimized model 
4) Load and run your optimized model in production

```python
import torch
import torchvision.models as models
from speedster import optimize_model, save_model

#1 Provide input model and data (we support PyTorch Dataloaders and custom input, see the docs to learn more)
model = models.resnet50()  
input_data = [((torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256), ), torch.tensor([0])) for _ in range(100)]

#2 Run Speedster optimization
optimized_model = optimize_model(
    model, 
    input_data=input_data, 
    optimization_time="constrained",
    metric_drop_ths=0.05
)

#3 Save the optimized model
save_model(optimized_model, "model_save_path")
```

Once the optimization is completed, start using the accelerated model (on steroids 🚀) in your DL framework of choice.

```python
#4 Load and run your PyTorch accelerated model in production
from speedster import load_model

optimized_model = load_model("model_save_path")

output = optimized_model(input_sample)
```

# **Key concepts**

Speedster's design reflects our mission to automatically master each and every existing AI acceleration technique to deliver the most cost-efficient AI ever. As a result, `Speedster` leverages available enterprise-grade open-source optimization tools. If these tools and  communities already exist, and are distributed under a permissive license (Apache, MIT, etc), we integrate them and happily contribute to their communities. However, many tools do not exist yet, in which case we implement them and open-source the code so that our community can benefit from it.

`Speedster` is shaped around **4 building blocks** and leverages a modular design to foster scalability and integration of new acceleration components across the software to hardware stack.

- [x]  **Converter:** converts the input model from its original framework to the framework backends supported by `Speedster`, namely PyTorch, ONNX and TensorFlow. This allows the Compressor and Compiler modules to apply any optimization technique to the model.
- [x]  **Compressor:** applies various compression techniques to the model, such as pruning, knowledge distillation, or quantization-aware training.
- [x]  **Compiler:** converts the compressed models to the intermediate representation (IR) of the supported deep learning compilers. The compilers apply both post-training quantization techniques and graph optimizations, to produce compiled binary files.
- [x]  **Inference Learner:** takes the best performing compiled model and converts it back into the same interface as the original input model.

The **compressor** stage leverages the following open-source projects:

- [Intel/neural-compressor](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor): targeting to provide unified APIs for network compression technologies, such as low precision quantization, sparsity, pruning, knowledge distillation, across different deep learning frameworks to pursue optimal inference performance.
- [SparseML](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml): libraries for applying sparsification recipes to neural networks with a few lines of code, enabling faster and smaller models.

The **compiler stage** leverages the following open-source projects:

- [Apache TVM](https://github.com/apache/tvm): open deep learning compiler stack for cpu, gpu and specialized accelerators.
- [BladeDISC](https://github.com/alibaba/BladeDISC): end-to-end Dynamic Shape Compiler project for machine learning workloads.
- [DeepSparse](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse): neural network inference engine that delivers GPU-class performance for sparsified models on CPUs.
- [OpenVINO](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino): open-source toolkit for optimizing and deploying AI inference.
- [ONNX Runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime): cross-platform, high performance ML inferencing and training accelerator
- [TensorRT](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT): C++ library for high performance inference on NVIDIA GPUs and deep learning accelerators.
- [TFlite](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro) and [XLA](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/compiler/xla): open-source libraries to accelerate TensorFlow models.
